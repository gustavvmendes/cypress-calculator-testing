This project automates end-to-end functional tests for an online calculator web application using Cypress. It verifies that the calculator performs basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—correctly by simulating user interactions and validating the displayed results. The tests ensure the core calculator functionalities work as expected on the public demo site.
